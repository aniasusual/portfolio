      I have a knack for solving problems. You can see my work in my portfolio.
      I'm currently developing an innovative desktop solution in{" "}
      <b>ElectronJs </b>
      designed to enhance all kinds of meetings. This tool transcribes the other
      participant's voice in real-time and instantly generates smart,
      context-aware responses—just like an <b>AI-powered teleprompter</b>. You
      simply speak the suggested reply, perfectly timed to the conversation.
      We're also working on advanced features like on-screen text recognition to
      generate real-time solutions based on visual content—without revealing
      anything on screen shares. It's seamless, intelligent, and designed to
      keep you one step ahead in every conversation.{" "}
      <b>Stay tuned—launch coming soon.</b>
