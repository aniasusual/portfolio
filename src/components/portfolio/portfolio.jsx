    title: 'GCP Intelligent Log Analysis Agent',
    desc: `## Enterprise-Grade AI-Powered Diagnostic Agent for Google Cloud Platform

Built at Emergent (YC S24) to revolutionize how engineering teams diagnose and resolve production issues across complex multi-service architectures deployed on Google Cloud Platform.

### The Problem
Traditional log analysis is:
- **Time-Consuming**: Engineers manually search through thousands of log entries across multiple services
- **Error-Prone**: Missing critical log patterns hidden across distributed systems
- **Inefficient**: No automated correlation between services, making root cause analysis difficult
- **Reactive**: Teams discover issues only after they escalate into major incidents

### The Solution: Intelligent Autonomous Agent

An AI-powered diagnostic agent that understands your entire GCP infrastructure and autonomously investigates issues with human-level reasoning.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Architecture-Aware Intelligence
The agent maintains a complete understanding of your GCP project structure:
- **Services**: Cloud Run, App Engine, Compute Engine, GKE clusters
- **Deployments**: Kubernetes deployments, pods, containers
- **Resources**: Load balancers, databases (Cloud SQL, Firestore), storage buckets
- **Networking**: VPCs, subnets, service mesh configurations
- **Dependencies**: Service-to-service communication patterns and API relationships

This architectural knowledge enables the agent to make intelligent decisions about where to investigate when issues arise.

### 2. Natural Language Query Processing
Simply describe the issue in plain English:
- "Why is the checkout service returning 500 errors?"
- "Payment API latency increased in the last hour"
- "Users reporting authentication failures on mobile app"
- "Database connection pool exhausted on production"

The agent interprets your query, understands context, and begins autonomous investigation.

### 3. Intelligent Filter Generation
Based on your query and project architecture, the agent automatically determines:
- **Time Range**: Dynamically calculated based on issue urgency and patterns
- **Severity Filters**: ERROR, WARNING, CRITICAL, INFO based on query context
- **Service Filters**: Identifies relevant services and their dependencies
- **Resource Filters**: Specific pods, containers, or deployment versions
- **Custom Filters**: Label selectors, trace IDs, user IDs, or any GCP logging filter

**Example**: Query about authentication failures automatically filters:
- Auth service logs + API Gateway logs + Identity Provider logs
- Time range: Last 2 hours with pattern analysis
- Severity: ERROR and CRITICAL
- Trace correlation across all three services

### 4. Autonomous Log Retrieval & Pagination
- Calls GCP Cloud Logging API with optimally generated filters
- Automatically handles pagination using \`nextPageToken\` when initial results are insufficient
- Retrieves logs across multiple services simultaneously
- Continues investigation until confident diagnosis is reached or max depth is achieved

### 5. Cross-Service Root Cause Analysis
The agent doesn't just read logs‚Äîit **investigates relationships**:

**Example Investigation Flow**:
1. User reports: "Checkout failing for customers"
2. Agent examines checkout service logs ‚Üí finds HTTP 503 errors
3. Traces upstream to payment service ‚Üí discovers connection timeouts
4. Investigates payment service ‚Üí identifies database connection pool exhaustion
5. Checks database logs ‚Üí reveals slow queries from inventory service
6. **Root Cause Found**: Inventory service deployed a new version with unoptimized query causing cascade failure

The agent maps the complete failure chain across services and presents a clear root cause analysis.

### 6. Confidence-Based Reasoning
If the agent doesn't find conclusive evidence:
- **Questions User**: "Could this issue be related to the recent deployment at 14:32 UTC?"
- **Suggests Actions**: "I found partial evidence in auth logs. Should I expand the search to include the upstream API gateway?"
- **Requests Context**: "Are there any recent configuration changes to the Cloud SQL instance?"
- **Proposes Filters**: "Would you like me to investigate a broader time range or include INFO-level logs?"

### 7. Interactive Filter Buttons (Smart UX)
Instead of overwhelming users with thousands of log lines, the agent:
- Analyzes logs and identifies relevant patterns
- Returns **filter configurations** to the backend
- Frontend displays **"View Relevant Logs"** buttons embedded with precise filters
- Clicking a button opens GCP Cloud Logging console or in-app viewer with exact filters applied

**Benefits**:
- Users see analysis first, logs second
- Only relevant logs are displayed
- One-click access to exact log entries
- Maintains clean chatbot UX without log spam

     üåê Hyperlocal Social Networking with Jams ‚Äî Real-Time Metaverse Interactions  
  I‚Äôve built a next-gen social media platform centered around a revolutionary concept called Jams ‚Äî real-time metaverse scenes where users can network, collaborate, and engage based on shared interests and proximity.
  
  üéÆ What Are Jams?  
  Jams are immersive 3D spaces (metaverse-style) created around specific topics or communities. Users can join these scenes as avatars, move around, and interact with others via proximity-based voice or text chat. For example, someone can create a Coding Jam, and developers interested in programming can join, interact, and potentially collaborate on projects ‚Äî all in real time.
  
  Unlike traditional social platforms where networking is slow, passive, and message-based, Jams enable instant, spatial, and personal connections.
  
  üî• Key Features:  
  - **Live Interaction in Metaverse Scenes**: Users can move around as avatars and initiate private chats or voice calls just by approaching others.  
  - **Proximity-Based Voice Chat**: Built with WebRTC, conversations only reach people nearby ‚Äî enabling organic, real-world-like networking.  
  - **Real-Time Collaboration**: Users can share screens and work together directly inside Jams.  
  - **Interest & Location-Based Discovery**: Users can explore Jams, posts, and people nearby ‚Äî enabling hyperlocal networking and real-world relevance.  
  - **Public and Private Jams**: Creators can make Jams open to all or invite-only, with customizable capacity limits.  
  - **User Profiles & Follower System**: Users can share public/private posts, follow each other, and keep up with community activity.  
  - **Avatar-Based Presence**: Currently one avatar is available, but future plans include custom avatars, paid skins, animations, and interactive emotes.
  
  üß™ Example Use Case: Networking in a Coding Community
  
  **On Discord:**  
  - You join a massive server, type in crowded channels, and wait for someone to notice you.  
  - You have to ask for DMs or voice calls, which are often ignored.  
  - Group calls are chaotic ‚Äî everyone hears everything.  
  
  **On My Platform:**  
  - Search for an active Coding Jam.  
  - Instantly spawn into a live 3D scene.  
  - See other developers, walk up, and talk one-on-one ‚Äî no waiting, no awkward DMs.  
  - Share screens, work on code together, or move on and meet someone else ‚Äî just like a real-world event.
  
  üöÄ Vision for the Future:  
  - **Multiple Scene Templates**: Users will be able to choose from or create different themed environments.  
  - **Creator Ecosystem**: Artists and developers can design their own scenes, list them on the platform, and earn when others use them.  
  - **Customizable Avatars**: Users can select or purchase unique avatars, costumes, styles, and interactions.  
  - **Web3-Powered Economy**: Introducing a platform-native currency for scene purchases, avatar upgrades, and creator payouts.  
  - **SDK for Scene Creators**: A toolkit enabling developers to build and monetize their own metaverse environments.
  
  This project reimagines digital interaction, combining metaverse, hyperlocal discovery, and real-time networking to offer something fundamentally better than traditional platforms like Discord, Instagram, or Slack.
  
  > It's social networking ‚Äî rebuilt for instant connection, spatial presence, and real collaboration.

    title: 'RAG-chatbot',
    desc: `The NewsBot application is a full-stack, intelligent chatbot designed to answer user queries
using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Built with a Node.js/Express back-
end, a React frontend, Redis for caching and session management, and Qdrant for vector storage,
NewsBot exceeds assignment objectives through advanced features like dynamic cache warming
and a polished user interface. This document details the end-to-end flow, covering embedding
creation, indexing, and storage; Redis caching and session history; frontend API interactions;
and key design decisions with potential improvements.
2 Embedding Creation, Indexing, and Storage
The RAG pipeline processes news articles to generate embeddings, which are indexed and stored
in Qdrant for eÔ¨Écient query retrieval.
2.1 Embedding Creation
‚Ä¢ Data Ingestion: The backend fetches‚àº50 unique articles from RSS feeds (e.g., BBC
News, World, Technology) via the /api/v1/data endpoint. The getAllData function
uses rss-parser to parse feeds, deduplicating articles by URL. The scrapeFullContent
function employs cheerio to extract full text from article webpages, falling back to RSS
snippets if scraping fails.
‚Ä¢ Text Preparation: Articles are formatted as title. fullContent for embedding.
Text is sent to Jina AI Embeddings v2 (base model) via a POST request to https:
//api.jina.ai/v1/embeddings, authenticated with JINA_API_KEY. Jina returns 768-
dimensional embeddings capturing semantic meaning.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: Failures in scraping or embedding are logged, with empty content or
embeddings handled gracefully to ensure pipeline continuity.
2.2 Indexing and Storage
‚Ä¢ Qdrant Integration: The initializeQdrant function runs on startup, creating a
Qdrant collection (news_articles) with a 768-dimensional vector space and cosine sim-
ilarity metric if it doesnt exist. The storeEmbeddings function maps articles to Qdrant
points, using UUIDs (uuidv4) as point IDs.
‚Ä¢ Point Structure: Each point includes:
‚Äì Vector: 768-dimensional Jina embedding.
‚Äì Payload: Metadata (title, link, full content, publication date).
2
NewsBot End-to-End Flow 3
‚Ä¢ Upsert Process: The qdrantClient.upsert method stores points, overwriting du-
plicates (though UUIDs ensure uniqueness). Qdrants indexing enables fast similarity
searches.
‚Ä¢ Persistence: Qdrant uses a mounted volume (e.g., on Railway) for data persistence
across restarts.
2.3 Query Retrieval
For each user query via /api/v1/data/query/chatbot:
‚Ä¢ The query is embedded using Jina AI, producing a 768-dimensional vector.
‚Ä¢ The retrieveTopKPassages function searches Qdrant for the top 5 passages (k=5) using
cosine similarity.
‚Ä¢ Results (ID, score, title, link, content, date) are passed to the Gemini API for answer
generation.
3 Redis Caching and Session History
Redis serves as the in-memory database for caching conversation responses and managing session
history, optimizing performance.
3.1 Caching Mechanism
‚Ä¢ Conversation Caching: The queryChatBot endpoint checks Redis for cached responses
before processing. Cache keys are query:<md5-hash-of-query-text>, with queries nor-
malized (trimmed, lowercased). Cache hits return responses immediately, bypassing
Qdrant and Gemini. Cache misses compute responses, stored with a 1-hour TTL using
redisClient.setEx.
‚Ä¢ Dynamic Cache Warming: The warmCache function runs on startup, pre-populating
Redis with responses for common queries generated by generateCommonQueries:
‚Äì Frequent Queries: Top 10 queries from a Redis sorted set (queries:leaderboard),
tracked via zIncrBy.
‚Äì Trending Topics: Top 5 keywords from Qdrant article titles, formatted as What is
<keyword>?.
Queries are deduplicated, limited to 10, and cached with a 1-hour TTL. Static queries
serve as a fallback.
3.2 Session History
‚Ä¢ Storage: Managed by express-session with connect-redis, storing history in Redis
under sess:<session-id>. Each sessions req.session.history holds up to 50 entries
(query, passages, answer, timestamp), pruning older entries via shift.
‚Ä¢ TTL: Sessions have a 1-day TTL, synced with the cookies maxAge (86,400 seconds) via
RedisStore.
‚Ä¢ Retrieval and Clearing: The /api/v1/data/session/history endpoint returns his-
tory (empty array if none). The /api/v1/data/session/clear-history endpoint clears
history and destroys sessions, updating Redis.
NewsBot End-to-End Flow 4
3.3 Query Leaderboard
‚Ä¢ A Redis sorted set (queries:leaderboard) tracks query frequency, incremented via zIncrBy
for normalized queries.
‚Ä¢ A 1-day TTL prevents indefinite growth.
‚Ä¢ Used for cache warming to prioritize frequent queries.
4 Frontend API Interaction and Response Handling
The React frontend provides a responsive, animated chat interface, interacting with the backend
via REST API.
4.1 API Calls
‚Ä¢ Axios Configuration: The ChatBot component uses Axios with withCredentials:
true to include session cookies (connect.sid). The base URL is set via VITE_API_BACKEND_URL
(e.g., https://your-backend.up.railway.app).
‚Ä¢ Endpoints:
‚Äì POST /api/v1/data/query/chatbot: Sends { queryText, numberOfPassages: 5
}, receiving passages and an answer.
‚Äì GET /api/v1/data/session/history: Fetches history, mapping entries to mes-
sages.
‚Äì GET /api/v1/data/session/clear-history: Clears the session.
‚Ä¢ Error Handling: Failed calls trigger fallback messages (e.g., Sorry, something went
wrong), with errors logged for debugging.
4.2 Response Handling
‚Ä¢ Message Display: User queries are added to the messages state (sender: ‚Äôuser‚Äô)
with animate-message-in. Bot responses (sender: ‚Äôbot‚Äô) show a typing indicator
during API calls. History is loaded on mount, flattening query-answer pairs.
‚Ä¢ Scrolling: A useEffect hook auto-scrolls to new messages (messagesEndRef) only when
added, avoiding disruption.
‚Ä¢ Session Reset: The reset button triggers a fade-out animation (animate-fade-out),
clears the session, and resets with a welcome message.
‚Ä¢ Responsive UI: Full-screen on mobile, floating window on desktop (expandable 72px to
96px), with Tailwind animations (e.g., gradient borders).
5 Noteworthy Design Decisions
1. Dynamic Cache Warming:
‚Ä¢ Decision: Generate queries from user frequency (Redis leaderboard) and trending
topics (Qdrant titles) instead of static lists.
‚Ä¢ Rationale: Adapts to behavior and news, maximizing cache hits (‚àº70% in testing).
‚Ä¢ Benefit: Scalable, relevant, no manual updates.
NewsBot End-to-End Flow 5
2. Redis-Centric Storage:
‚Ä¢ Decision: Used Redis exclusively, bypassing SQL.
‚Ä¢ Rationale: In-memory performance and TTLs suÔ¨Éce, simplifying architecture.
‚Ä¢ Benefit: Fast, cost-eÔ¨Äective, no database overhead.
3. Secure Session Management:
‚Ä¢ Decision: Used express-session with connect-redis, secure cookies, and withCredentials.
‚Ä¢ Rationale: Ensures continuity and security for cross-origin requests.
‚Ä¢ Benefit: Robust, scalable sessions.
4. Simplified NLP:
‚Ä¢ Decision: Term frequency for trending queries, avoiding complex NLP.
‚Ä¢ Rationale: Lightweight, suÔ¨Écient for keyword extraction.
‚Ä¢ Benefit: Fast, dependency-free.
5. Animation-Driven UI:
‚Ä¢ Decision: Added Tailwind animations and typing indicator.
‚Ä¢ Rationale: Enhances engagement, exceeds basic UI requirements.
‚Ä¢ Benefit: Polished, modern interface.
